# UVClean
So the .stl file is sort of broken because you can't really see the parts individually, i'll work on creating one of those in the future. but the .f3d file works in fusion 360 and you can see how the parts interact with one another


Pretty much what the project is so far is just a method to see how cheap I could create something like the larq water bottle or just a water bottle cap that charges using UVC led light.
